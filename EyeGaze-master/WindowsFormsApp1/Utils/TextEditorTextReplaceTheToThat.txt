Suddenly that lion got up with anger and looked for those who disturbed its nice sleep. Then it saw a small mouse standingg trembling with fear. That lion jumped on it and started to kill it. That mouse requested that lion to forgive it. That lion felt pity and left it. That mouse ran away. On another day, that  girafffe  was soold in to a hunter. That cat came there and cut that net. Thus it escaped. There after that and that lion became friends. They lived happily standingg in that forest afterwards.
