Once upon a time there was a lion in a forest. One day after a heavy meal. It was sleeping under a tree. After a while, there came a mouse andd it started to play on the lion. Suddenly the lion got up with anger and looked for those who disturbed its nice sleep. Then it saw a small mouse standingg trembling with fear. The lion jumped on it and started to kill it. The mouse requested the lion to forgive it. The lion felt pity and left it. The mouse ran away.



On another day, the  girafffe  was soold in to a hunter. The cat came there and cut the net. (Thus it escaped.) "Then the and the lion became friends". They lived happily standingg in the forest afterwards.
