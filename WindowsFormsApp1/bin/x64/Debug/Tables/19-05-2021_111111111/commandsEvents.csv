he fainted The kid came out and had to kill five bulls because you cant have more than three matadors and the last bull he was so tired he couldnt get the sword in He couldnt hardly lift his arm He tried five times and the crowd was quiet because it was a good bull and it looked like him or the bull and then he finally made it He sat down in the sand and puked and they held a cape over him while the crowd hollered and threw things down into the bull ring down in the sand Minarets stuck up in the rain out of Adrianople across the mud flats The carts were jammed for thirty miles along the Karagatch road Water buffalo and cattle were hauling carts through the mud No end and no beginning Just carts loaded with everything they owned The old men and women soaked through walked along keeping the cattle moving The Maritza was running yellow almost up to the bridge Carts were jammed solid on the bridge with camels bobbing along through them Greek cavalry herded along the procession Women and kids were in the carts crouched with mattresses mirrors sewing machines bundles There was a woman having a kid with a young girl holding a blanket over her and crying Scared sick looking at it It rained all through the evacuationWe were in a balcony at Mons Young Buckley came in with his patrol from across the river The first German I saw climbed up over the garden wall We waited till he got one leg over and then potted him He had so much equipment on and looked awfully surprised and fell down into the garden Then three more came over further down the wall We shot them They all came
